# List of metrics to implement:

A few structural complexity metrics based on more theoretical approaches are:
- Bertz’s Ns and Nt index: Bertz, S. H. & Sommer, T. J. Rigorous mathematical approaches to strategic bonds and synthetic analysis based on conceptually simple new complexity indices. Chem. Commun. 16, 2409–2410 (1997).

- Randić's zeta index: Randić, M. & Plavšić, D. Characterization of molecular complexity. Int. J. Quantum Chem. 91, 20–31 (2002).

- Rücker's total walk count (twc) index: Rücker, G.; Rücker, C. Counts of All Walks as Atomic and Molecular Descriptors. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1993, 33, 683-695. 

- Proudfoot's Cm index based on atom environments: Proudfoot, J. R. A path based approach to assessing molecular complexity. Bioorganic Med. Chem. Lett. 27, 2014–2017 (2017).

Two noteworthy substructure-based methods are:
- Barone, R. & Chanon, M. A new and simple approach to chemical complexity. Application to the synthesis of natural products. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 41, 269–272 (2001).

- Whitlock, H. W. On the structure of total synthesis of complex natural products. J. Org. Chem. 63, 7982–7989 (1998).
